In this project, we have implemented Fuzzy-C-Means and its 4 variants in reference to the
research paper “Fuzzy C-mean based brain MRI segmentation algorithms” by M. A. Balafar.

This repository contains the reference paper, the matlab code used to perform segmentation, the data used to perform segmentation, matlab reports of the segmentations performed and a preentation of the results.
